This directory contains basic versions of the bakery algorithm
and "simplified" bakery algorithms as described in Chapter 18.

The reader is invited to experiment by changing it to see why various
aspects of the algorithms are necessary to achieve mutual exclusion,
what happens when the limit MaxI is changed, or the number of threads.

It also provides a very striking illustration of how valuable the
use of compression is for SVA.
