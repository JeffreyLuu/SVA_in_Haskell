This directory contains versions of a number of standard
mutual exclusion algorithms, most of which can be found in
Chapters 18 and 19.  All except petersonN are binary and represent
small examples for SVA.

One of them, as discussed in the book, does not work properly.

Of course the bakery algorithm is also a mutual exclusion algorithm,
but it has its own separate directories.

Applications of mutual exclusion can also be found in the
dining philosopher directory svdphils.
