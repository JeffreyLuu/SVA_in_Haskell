This directory contains two example files illustrating the use
of OVERSEERS in SVA: processes that run with priority until completion 
whenever one of their variables is assigned to.

See Section 19.5 of UCS for further explanation and the origin of these
examples.

cq.svl  implements a circular queue
lq.svl  implements a queue in which all data is shifted to the front

So the above are intended to be equivalent implementations of the
same externally visible type.
