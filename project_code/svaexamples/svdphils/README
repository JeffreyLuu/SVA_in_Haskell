This directory contains versions of the dining philosophers with
the forks replaced by explicit mutual exclusions over shared
variables.  

Many of the example files for SVA were originally written by the author
in the CSP data type variant of the input language and then translated
into more conventional SVL when this became available to use with the
right version of the shared variable compiler.

The files in this directory have been left in this format both to
illustrate it and because, at the time of writing, SVL does not provide
procedures of the form used in the CSP variant (and quoted
under this example in the book).  The fact that they
are OK in the CSP variant is simply through use of the ordinary
structures of CSPM.

The sort of procedures we mean are the named phases of the philosopher
processes.

They also differ in that Peterson's algorithm is used rather than Dekker,
and the indexes of the mutex threads are 0,1 rather than 1,2.

We will implement the book version of at least one of these files when
SVL has procedures implemented.
