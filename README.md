# SVA_in_Haskell
Fourth year project by Shengwei Lu

## Instruction
To compile the program, go to ```/project_code``` directory and run the following command:
```ghc Main.hs -odir compilation/ -hidir compilation/```

To run the program to get the compiled result, run the following command:
```./Main ```
or run the following to output the compilation result into output.csp:
```./Main > example/output.csp```

The ```output.csp``` file can be loaded into FDR for further verification.

## File Structure
The project code directory contains the source code for the compiler.
In the Main.hs file, user can choose which input file to use. To do so, simply comment out the currently selected file and uncomment the file that needs to be run. User can then follow the instruction above to get the output.

The ```svaexamples``` directory contains the sample codes written in SVL. This directory is copied directly from SVA2.

The ```compilation``` directory contains all the intermediate files when compiling the program.

The ```comparison``` directory contains the compiled CSP programs generated by SVA2, when the files in ```svaexamples``` are loaded. There files can be loaded into FDR for comparison.

Finally, the ```example``` directory contains some compiled CSP programs generated by our compiler. Ideally, any newly generated output should also be stored in this directory.
